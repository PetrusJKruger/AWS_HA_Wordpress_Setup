For your wordpress site, you'll need to configure your EC2 instances with the following steps:

* SSH into your EC2 instance
* Check that the appache service is running.
  * service httpd status
  * service httpd start
* Navigate to ip address
* Do Wordpress Setup
  * Use your RDS instances endpoint for the database host
  * Create the wp-config,php file using the terminal
  * If this process hangs, your security group is probably blocking port 3306
  * Complete Setup
* Login to WP

To force Cloudfront to store all uploaded photo's to S3:

In the terminal window:
* Type aws s3 ls
 * If you cannot see your S3 buckets, you'll need to add the role.
* Copy files to s3 using:
 * aws s3 cp --recursive /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads s3://...media bucket
* Copy code to s3 using:
 *  aws s3 cp --recursive /var/www/html/ s3://...code bucket
* Edit the .htaccess file to point to the s3 media bucket
 * Get domain name from cloudfront
* Setup sync to s3 using:
 * aws s3 sync /var/html/ s3://...code bucket
* Tell apache that we will allow url rewrite using:
 * cd /etc/httpd
 * cd conf
 * ls
 * cp httpd.conf httpd-copy.conf #for backup of file
 * nano httpd.conf
 * Scroll to "AllowOverride" rule
 * Change rule to "All"
 * service httpd restart #to restart apache just in case it needs a kickstart to pick up changes
 * change bucket policy for media s3 bucket

For your wordpress site, you'll need to configure your EC2 instances with the following steps:

* SSH into your EC2 instance
* Check that the appache service is running.
  * service httpd status
  * service httpd start
* Navigate to ip address
* Do Wordpress Setup
  * Use your RDS instances endpoint for the database host
  * Create the wp-config,php file using the terminal
  * If this process hangs, your security group is probably blocking port 3306
  * Complete Setup
* Login to WP
